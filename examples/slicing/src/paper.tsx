    <Abstract>
      Program slicing, or identifying the subset of a program relevant to a value, relies on
      understanding the dataflow of a program. In languages with mutable pointers and functions like
      C or Java, tracking dataflow has historically required whole-program analysis, which can be be
      slow and challenging to integrate in practice. Advances in type systems have shown how to
      modularly track dataflow through the concept of ownership. We demonstrate that ownership can
      modularize program slicing by using types to compute a provably sound and reasonably precise
      approximation of mutation. We present an algorithm for slicing Oxide, a formalized
      ownership-based language, and prove the algorithm's soundness as a form of noninterference.
      Then we describe an implementation of the algorithm for the Rust programming language, and
      show empirically that modular slices are the same as whole-program slices in 95.4% of slices
      drawn from large Rust codebases.

        Program slicing is the task of identifying the subset of a program relevant to computing a
        value of interest. The concept of slicing was introduced 40 years ago when{" "}
        <Cite f v="weiser1982programmers" /> demonstrated that programmers mentally construct slices
        while debugging. Since then, hundreds of papers have been published on implementing
        automated program slice, as surveyed by{" "}
        <Cite f v={["xu2005brief", "silva2012vocabulary"]} />. Despite these efforts, a review of
        slicers found <q>slicing-based debugging techniques are rarely used in practice</q>{" "}
        <Cite v="parnin2011automated" />
        <Footnote>
          The only open-source, functioning slicers the authors could find are Frama-C{" "}
          <Cite v="cuoq2012frama" /> and dg <Cite v="llvmslicer" />. Slicing tools for Java like
          Kaveri <Cite v="jayaraman2005kaveri" /> no longer work. The most industrial-strength
          slicing tool, CodeSurfer <Cite v="balakrishnan2005codesurfer" /> was GrammaTech's
          proprietary technology and appears to no longer exist.
        </Footnote>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        A major challenge for slicing is addressing the underlying program analysis problems. At a
        high level, slicing is about dataflow --- if <$>x</$> is relevant, then any means by which
        data flows into <$>x</$> are also relevant. In today's programming languages, analyzing
        dataflow is difficult because of the interaction of two features: functions and pointers.
        For example, imagine slicing a value in a function <$>f</$> which calls a function <$>g</$>.
        In a language without side-effects, then the only relevance <$>g</$> could possibly have in{" "}
        <$>f</$> is its return value. But in a language that allows effects such as mutation on
        pointers, <$>g</$> could modify data used within <$>f</$>, requiring a pointer analysis.
        Moreover, if <$>f</$> is a higher-order function parameterized on <$>g</$>, then the slice
        must consider all the possible functions that <$>g</$> could be, i.e. control-flow analysis.
      </p>

      <p>
        The standard solution for analyzing programs with pointers and functions is{" "}
        <em>whole-program analysis</em>. That is, for a given function of interest, analyze the
        definitions of all of the function's callers and callees in the current codebase. However,
        whole-program analysis suffers from a few logistical and conceptual issues:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Analysis time scales with the size of the whole program:</em> the time complexity of
          whole-program analysis scales either polynomially or exponentially with the number of call
          sites in the program, depending on context-sensitivity <Cite v="might2010resolving" />. In
          practice, this means more complex codebases can take substantially longer to analyze. For
          instance, the recent PSEGPT pointer analysis tool <Cite v="zhao2018parallel" /> takes 1
          second on a codebase of 282,000 lines of code and 3 minutes on a codebase of 2.2 million
          lines of code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Analysis requires access to source code for the whole program:</em> an assumption of
          analyzing a whole program is that a whole program is actually accessible. However, many
          programs use libraries that are shipped as pre-compiled objects with no source code,
          either for reasons of efficiency or intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Analysis results are anti-modular:</em> when analyzing a particular function, relying
          on calling contexts to analyze the function's inputs means that any results are not
          universal. Calling-context-sensitive analysis determine whether two pointers alias{" "}
          <em>in the context of the broader codebase</em>, so alias analysis results can change due
          to modifications in code far away from the current module.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        These issues are not new --- <Cite v="rountev1999data" f /> and{" "}
        <Cite v="cousot2002modular" f /> observed the same two decades ago when arguing for modular
        static analysis. The key insight arising from their research is that static analysis can be
        modularized by computing <em>symbolic procedure summaries</em>. For instance,{" "}
        <Cite v="yorsh2008generating" f /> show how to automatically summarize which inputs and
        outputs are possibly null for a given Java function. The analysis is modular because a
        function's summary can be computed only given the summaries, and not definitions, of callees
        in the function. In such prior work, the language of symbolic procedure summaries has been
        defined in a separate formal system from the programming language being analyzed, such as
        the micro-transformer framework of <Cite v="yorsh2008generating" f />.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work begins with the observation:{" "}
        <em>function type signatures are symbolic procedure summaries</em>. The more expressive a
        language's type system, the more behavior that can be summarized by a type. Nearly all work
        on program slicing, dataflow analysis, and procedure summaries has operated on C, Java, or
        equivalents. These languages have impoverished type systems, and so any interesting static
        analysis requires a standalone abstract interpreter. However, if a language's type system
        were expressive enough to encode information about dataflow, then a function's type
        signature could be used to reason about the aliasing and side effects needed for slicing.
        Moreover, a function's type signature is required information for a compiler to export when
        building a library. Using the type system for dataflow analysis therefore obviates the
        logistical challenge of integrating an external analysis tool into a complex build system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the primary technique for managing dataflow with types is <em>ownership</em>.
        Ownership is a concept that has emerged from several intersecting lines of research on
        linear logic <Cite v="girard1987linear" />, class-based alias management{" "}
        <Cite v="clarke1998ownership" />, and region-based memory management{" "}
        <Cite v="grossman2002region" />. Generally, ownership refers to a system where values are
        owned by an entity, which can temporarily or permanently transfer ownership to other
        entities. The type system then statically tracks the flow of ownership between entities.
        Ownership-based type systems enforce the invariant that values are not simultaneously
        aliased and mutated, either for the purposes of avoiding memory errors, data races, or
        abstraction violations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our thesis is that ownership can modularize program slicing by using types to compute a
        provably sound and reasonably precise approximation of the necessary dataflow information.
        We build this thesis in five parts:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We provide an intuition for the relationship between ownership and slicing by describing
          how ownership works in Rust, the only industrial-grade ownership-based programming
          language today (
          <Ref name="sec:background" />
          ).
        </li>
        <li>
          We formalize an algorithm for modular static slicing as an extension to the type system of
          Oxide <Cite v="weiss2019oxide" />, a formal model of Rust's static and dynamic semantics (
          <Ref name="sec:model" /> and <Ref name="sec:algorithm" />
          ).
        </li>
        <li>
          We prove the soundness of this algorithm as a form of noninterference, building on the
          connection between slicing and information flow established by{" "}
          <Cite v="abadi1999core" f /> (
          <Ref name="sec:soundness" /> and <Ref name="sec:appendix" />
          ).
        </li>
        <li>
          We describe an implementation of the slicing algorithm for Rust, translating the core
          insights of the algorithm to work on a lower-level control-flow graph (
          <Ref name="sec:implementation" />)
        </li>
        <li>
          We evaluate the precision of the modular Rust slicer against a whole-program slicer on a
          dataset of 10 codebases with a total of 280k LOC. We find that modular slices are the same
          size as whole-program slices 95.4% of the time, and are on average 7.6% larger in the
          remaining 4.6% of cases (<Ref name="sec:evaluation" />
          ).

        A backwards static slice is the subset of a program that could influence a particular value
        (backwards) under any possible execution (static). A slice is defined with respect to a
        slicing criterion, which is a variable at a particular point in a program. In this section,
        we provide an intuition for how slices interact with different features of the Rust
        programming language, namely: places (<Ref name="sec:places" />
        ), references (<Ref name="sec:pointers" />
        ), function calls (<Ref name="sec:funcalls" />
        ), and interior mutability (<Ref name="sec:intmut" />
        ).{" "}

          A place is a reference to a concrete piece of data in memory, like a variable <C>x</C> or

          For instance, the Rust snippet on the right shows the slice in orange of a place in green.
          The assignment <C>x = y</C> means <C>y</C> is relevant for the slice, so the statement{" "}
          <C>let y = 2</C> is relevant as well. Because <C>z</C> is not used in the computation of{" "}

          overwrites the previous value of <C>x</C>, then the original assignment <C>x = 1</C> is
          not relevant either.

          If a mutation is conditioned on a predicate (as in line 3 in the snippet on the left) then

          Slices on composite data structures are defined by whether a mutation conflicts with a
          particular path into the data structure. For example, consider slicing on a tuple as in
          the three snippets below (note that <C>t.n</C> gets the <$>n</$>-th field of the tuple{" "}
          <C>t</C>):
        </p>

t.1 = 7;
println!("{:?}", @t@);`}

        <p>
          In this program, when slicing on <C>t</C>, changing the value of a field of a structure
          changes the value of the whole structure, so <C>t.1 = 7</C> is part of the slice on{" "}
          <C>t</C>. However, when slicing on <C>t.0</C>, the path <C>t.0</C> is disjoint from the
          path <C>t.1</C>, so <C>t.1 = 7</C> is not part of the slice on <C>t.0</C>. Similarly, when
          slicing on <C>t.2</C>, the only relevant assignment is <C>t = (3, 4, 5)</C>. More
          generally, a place conflicts with another place if either's path is a prefix of the
          other's. For instance, <C>t.0</C> conflicts with both <C>t</C> (parent) and <C>t.0.1</C>{" "}
          (child) but not <C>t.1</C> (sibling). This leads to the first slicing principle:

        <p>
          This principle provides an intuition for making an algorithm that constructs slices. For
          instance, take the last example above on the left. On line 4, when <C>t.1</C> is mutated,
          that mutation is registered as part of the slice on every conflicting place, specifically{" "}

          Pointers are the first major challenge for slicing. A mutation to a dereferenced pointer
          is a mutation to any place that is possibly pointed-to, so such places must be known to
          the slicer. For example:

          Rust has two distinct types of pointers, which are called <q>references</q> to distinguish them
          from <q>raw pointers</q> with C-like behavior (discussed in <Ref name="sec:intmut" />
          ). For a given type <C>T</C>, there are immutable references of type <C>&T</C>, and
          mutable references of type <C>&mut T</C> which correspond respectively to the expressions{" "}
          <C>&x</C> and <C>&mut x</C>. Because <C>y</C> points to <C>x</C>, then the mutation
          through <C>y</C> is relevant to the read of <C>*z</C>. We refer to the left-hand side of
          assignment statements like <C>*y</C> as <q>place expressions</q>, since they could include
          dereferences.
        </p>

        <p>
          The task of determining what a reference can point-to is called <em>pointer analysis</em>{" "}
          . While many methods exist for pointer analysis <Cite v="smaragdakis2015pointer" />, our
          first key insight is that Rust's ownership types implicitly perform a kind of modular
          pointer analysis that we can leverage for slicing. To understand why, we first need to
          describe two ingredients: the goal, i.e. what ownership is trying to accomplish, and the
          mechanism, i.e. how ownership-checking is implemented in the type system.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core goal of ownership is eliminating simultaneous aliasing and mutation. In Rust,
          achieving this goal enables the use of references without garbage collection while
          retaining memory safety. For instance, these three classes of errors are all caught at
          compile-time:
        </p>

        <Row>
          <Listing
            code={r`// Dangling reference
let p = {
  let x = 1; &x
};
let y = *p;`}
          />
          <Listing
            code={r`// Use-after-free
let d = tempdir();
let d2 = &d;
d.close();
let p = d2.path();`}
          />
          <Listing
            code={r`// Iterator invalidation
let mut v = vec![1,2];
for x in v.iter() {
  v.push(*x);
}`}
          />
        </Row>

        <p>
          From left-to-right: the dangling references is caught because <C>x</C> is deallocated at
          the end of scope on line 4, which is a mutation, conflicting with the alias <C>&x</C>. The
          use-after-free is caught because <C>d.close()</C> requires ownership of <C>d</C>, which
          prevents an alias <C>d2</C> from being live. The iterator invalidation case is subtler:{" "}
          <C>x</C> is a pointer to data within <C>v</C>. However, <C>v.push(*x)</C> could resize{" "}
          <C>v</C> which would copy/deallocate all vector elements to a new heap location,
          invalidating all pointers to <C>v</C>. Hence <C>v.push(*x)</C> is a simultaneous mutation
          and alias of the vector.
        </p>

        <p>
          Catching these errors requires understanding which places are pointed by which references.
          For instance, knowing that <C>x</C> points to an element of <C>v</C> and not just any
          arbitrary <C>i32</C>. The key mechanism behind these ownership checks is{" "}
          <em>lifetimes</em>.

          Each reference expression and type has a corresponding lifetime, written explicitly in the
          syntax <C>'n</C> on the left, where <C>n</C> is an arbitrary and unique number. The name
          "lifetime" implies a model of lifetimes as the live range of the reference. Prior work on
          region-based memory management like <Cite f v="tofte1997region" /> and{" "}
          <Cite f v="grossman2002region" /> use this model.

        <p>
          However, recent work from <Cite f v="polonius" /> and <Cite f v="weiss2019oxide" /> have
          devised an alternative model of lifetimes as "provenances" or "origins" that more directly
          correspond to a pointer analysis. In essence, a lifetime is the set of places that a
          reference could point-to. For the above example, that would be <C>'n = x </C> for all{" "}
          <C>n</C>, because each reference points to <C>x</C>. As a more interesting example,
          consider the code on the left.

          There, lifetimes for borrow expressions are assigned to the place being borrowed, so{" "}
          <C>'0 = x </C> and <C>'1 = y </C>. Because <C>z</C> could be assigned to either reference,
          then <C>{`'2 = '0 ∪ '1 = {x, y}`}</C>. An expression of the form <C>& *p</C> is called a
          "reborrow", as the underlying address is being passed from one reference to another. To
          register that a reference is reborrowed, the reborrowed place is also added to the
          lifetime, so <C>{`'3 = '4 = {x, y, *z}`}</C>. More generally:

        <p>
          In the context of slicing, then to determine which places could be modified by a
          particular assignment, one only needs to look up the aliases in the lifetime of
          references. For instance, <C>*w = 1</C> would be part of a slice on <C>*z</C>, because{" "}
          <C>*z</C> is in the lifetime <C>'4</C> of <C>w</C>.

      <SubSection title="Function calls" name="sec:funcalls">
        <p>
          The other major challenge for slicing is function calls. For instance, consider slicing a
          call to an arbitrary function <C>f</C> with various kinds of inputs:
          <Footnote>
            Why is <C>String::from</C> needed? The literal <C>"Hello world"</C> has type{" "}
            <C>&'static str</C>, meaning an immutable reference to the binary's string pool which
            lives forever. The function <C>String::from</C> converts the immutable reference into a
            value of type <C>String</C>, which stores its contents on the heap and allows the string
            to be mutated.

        <p>
          The standard approach to slicing <C>f</C> would be to inspect the definition of <C>f</C>,
          and recursively slice it by translating the slicing criteria from caller to callee (e.g.
          see <Cite f v="weiser1982programmers" /> for an example). However, our goal is to avoid
          using the definition of <C>f</C> (i.e. a whole-program analysis) for the reasons described
          in <Ref name="sec:intro" />.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          To modularly slice through function calls, we need to approximate the effects of <C>f</C>{" "}
          in a manner that is sound, but also as precise as possible. Put another way, what
          mutations could possibly occur as a result of calling <C>f</C>? Consider the three cases
          that arise in the code above.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Passing a value <C>x</C> of type <C>String</C> (or generally of type <C>T</C>) moves the
            value into <C>f</C>. Therefore it is an ownership error to refer to <C>x</C> after
            calling <C>f</C> and we do not need to consider slices on <C>x</C> after <C>f</C>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Passing a value <C>y</C> of type <C>&String</C> (or <C>&T</C>) passes an immutable
            reference. Immutable references cannot be mutated, therefore <C>y</C> cannot change in{" "}
            <C>f</C>.
            <Footnote>
              A notable detail to the safety of immutable references is that immutability is
              transitive. For instance, if <C>b = &mut a</C> and <C>c = &b</C>, then <C>a</C> is
              guaranteed not to be mutated through <C>c</C>. This stands in contrast to other
              languages with pointers like C and C++ where the <C>const</C> keyword only protects
              values from mutation at the top-level, and not into the interior fields.
            </Footnote>
          </li>
          <li>
            Passing a value <C>z</C> of type <C>&mut String</C> (or <C>&mut T</C>) passes a mutable
            reference, which could possibly be mutated. This case is therefore the only observable
            of effect <C>f</C> apart from its return value.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Without inspecting <C>f</C>, we cannot know how a mutable reference is modified, so we
          have to conservatively assume that every argument was used as input to a mutation.
          Therefore the modular slice of each variable looks as in the snippets below:
        </p>

        <Row>
          <SliceListing
            prelude={"let f = |x: String, y: &String, z: &mut String| -> usize { 0 };"}

        <p id="multi-snippets">
          Note that like <C>z</C> (middle), the return value <C>w</C> (right) is also assumed to be
          influenced by every input to <C>f</C>. Implicit in these slices are additional assumptions
          about the limitations of <C>f</C>. For example, in C, a function could manufacture a
          pointer to the stack frame above it and mutate the values, meaning <C>f</C> could mutate{" "}
          <C>y</C> (even if <C>y</C> was not an input!). Similarly, functions could potentially read
          arbitrary data (e.g. global variables) that would influence mutations apart from just the
          arguments.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          However, allowing such pointer manipulation would easily break ownership safety, since
          fundamentally it permits unchecked aliasing. Hence, our principle:
        </p>

        <Principle
          type="function calls"
          text="When calling a function, (a) only mutable references in the arguments can be mutated, and (b) the mutations and return value are only influenced by the arguments."
        />

        <p>
          This principle is essentially a worst-case approximation to the function's effects. It is
          the core of how we can modularly slice programs, because a function's definition does not
          have to be inspected to analyze what it can mutate.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          A caveat to this principle is global variables: (
          <Ref name="prin:function calls" />
          -a) is not true with mutable globals, and (
          <Ref name="prin:function calls" />
          -b) is not true with read-only globals. Mutable globals are disallowed by the rules of
          ownership, as they are implicitly aliased and hence disallowed from being mutable.
          However, read-only globals are ownership-safe (and hence permitted in Rust). For
          simplicity we do not consider read-only globals in this work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another notable detail is the interaction of function calls and lifetimes. Pointer
          analysis, like slicing, has historically been done via whole-program analysis for maximum
          precision. However, Rust can analyze lifetimes (and subsequently what references point-to)
          modularly just by looking at the type signature of a called function using{" "}
          <em>lifetime parameters</em> . Consider the function <C>Vec::get_mut</C> that returns a
          mutable reference to an element of a vector. For instance, <C>vec![5, 6].get_mut(0)</C>{" "}
          returns a mutable reference to the value 5. This function has the type signature:
        </p>

        <Center style={{ margin: "1rem 0" }}>
          <C>{`Vec::get_mut   :   forall 'a, T . (&'a mut Vec<T>, usize) -> &'a mut T`}</C>
        </Center>

        <p>
          Because this type signature is parametric in the lifetime <C>'a</C>, it can express the
          constraint that the output reference <C>&'a mut T</C> must have the same lifetime as the
          input reference <C>{`&'a mut Vec<T>`}</C>. Therefore the returned pointer is known to
          point to the same data as the input pointer, but without inspecting the definition of{" "}
          <C>get_mut</C>.

      <SubSection title="Interior mutability" name="sec:intmut">

          The previous sections describe a slicing strategy for the subset of Rust known as "safe
          Rust", that is programs which strictly adhere to the rules of ownership. Importantly, Rust
          also has the <C>unsafe</C> feature that gives users access to raw pointers, or pointers
          with similar unchecked behavior to C. Most commonly, <C>unsafe</C> code is used to
          implement APIs that satisfy ownership, but not in a manner that is deducible by the type
          system. For example, shared mutable state between threads:

        <p>
          In this snippet, two threads have ownership over two values of type{" "}
          <C>{`Arc<Mutex<i32>>`}</C> which internally point to the same number. Both threads can
          call <C>Mutex::lock</C> which takes an immutable reference to an <C>{`&Mutex<i32>`}</C>{" "}
          and returns a mutable reference <C>&mut i32</C> to the data inside.
          <Footnote>
            Technically the returned type is a <C>{`LockResult<MutexGuard<'a, i32>>`}</C> but the
            distinction isn't relevant here.
          </Footnote>{" "}
          This nominally violates ownership, as the data is aliased (shared by two threads) and
          mutable (both can mutate).
        </p>

        <p>
          The mutex is ownership-safe only because its implementation ensures that both threads
          cannot <em>simultaneously</em> access the underlying value in accordance with the system
          mutex's semantics. For our purposes, the aliasing between <C>value</C> and{" "}
          <C>value_ref</C> is not possible to observe using the type system alone. For example, in
          our algorithm, slicing on <C>value</C> would <em>not</em> include mutations to{" "}
          <C>value_ref</C>. This is because the data inside the mutex has type <C>*mut i32</C> (a
          raw pointer), and without a lifetime attached, our algorithm has no way to determine
          whether <C>value</C> and <C>value_ref</C> are aliases just by inspecting their types.
        </p>

        <p>
          More broadly, modular slicing is only sound for safe Rust. The point of this work is to
          say: when a program can be statically determined to satisfy the rules of ownership, then
          modular slicing is sound. The principles above help clarify the specific assumptions made
          possible by ownership, which are otherwise impossible to make in languages like C or Java.{" "}
          <Cite f v="astrauskas2020programmers" /> found that 76.4% of published Rust projects
          contain no unsafe code, suggesting that safe Rust is more common than not. However, their
          study does not account for safe Rust built on internally-unsafe abstractions like{" "}
          <C>Mutex</C>, so it is difficult to estimate the true likelihood of soundness in practice.
          We discuss the issue of slicing with unsafe code further in{" "}

        To build an algorithm from these principles, we first need a formal model to describe and
        reason about the underlying language. Rather than devise our own, we build on the work of{" "}
        <Cite f v="weiss2019oxide" /> : Oxide is a model of (safe) Rust's surface language with a
        formal static and dynamic semantics, along with a proof of syntactic type soundness.

        algorithm.{" "}

        We will incrementally introduce the aspects of Oxide's syntax and semantics as necessary to
        understand our principles and algorithm. We describe Oxide's syntax (<Ref name="sec:syn" />
        ), static semantics (<Ref name="sec:statsem" />) and dynamic semantics (
        <Ref name="sec:dynsem" />
        ), and then apply these concepts to formalize the slicing principles of the previous section

        <p>The syntax is largely the same as Rust's with a few exceptions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Lifetimes are called "provenances", and they are both explicit in expressions and types
            throughout the program, and initially bound via <$>{r`\msf{letprov}`}</$> expressions or
            as function parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rather than having immutable references <C>&'a τ</C> and mutable references{" "}
            <C>&'a mut τ</C>, Oxide calls them "shared" references{" "}
            <$>{r`\tysref{\ownqshrd}{\prov}{\ty}`}</$> and "unique" references{" "}
            <$>{r`\tysref{\ownquniq}{\prov}{\ty}`}</$> .
          </li>
          <li>
            Provenances are divided into "concrete" (<$>{r`\concrprov`}</$>) and "abstract" (
            <$>{r`\abstrprov`}</$>). Concrete provenances are used by borrow expressions, and
            abstract provenances are function parameters used for inputs with reference type.
          </li>

          {" "}<$>{r`\tyenv`}</$> contains function-level type and provenance variables. <$>{r`\stackenv`}</$> maps variables to types and provenances to pointed-to place expressions with ownership qualifiers. For instance, when type checking <C>*b := a.1</C> in <Ref name="fig:oxide_syntax_example" /> , the inputs would be <$>{r`\tyenv = \tyenvempty`}</$> (empty) and <$>{r`\stackenv = \{a \mapsto (\uty, \uty),~ b \mapsto \eref{\uniq}{\r_2}{\uty},~ r_1 \mapsto \{\loanform{\uniq}{a.0}\},~ \r_2 \mapsto \{\loanform{\uniq}{a.0}\}\}`}</$>.
        </p>

        <p>Typechecking relies on a number of auxiliary judgments, such as subtyping (<Definition name="tex:subtype" Tooltip={() => <><$>{r`\subtype{\tyenv}{\stackenv}{\tau_1}{\tau_2}{\stackenv'}`}</$> means <$>\tau_1</$> is a subtype of <$>\tau_2</$></>}><$>{r`\subtype{\tyenv}{\stackenv}{\tau_1}{\tau_2}{\stackenv'}`}</$></Definition>) and ownership-safety (<Definition name="tex:ownsafe"><$>{r`\ownsafe{\tyenv}{\stackenv}{\ownq}{\pexp}{\loanset}`}</$>, read as "<$>{r`\pexp`}</$> has <$>{r`\ownq\text{-loans}`}</$> <$>{r`\loanset`}</$> in the contexts <$>{r`\Delta, \Gamma`}</$>"</Definition>). As an example, consider <Smallcaps>T-Assign</Smallcaps> <Cite v="weiss2019oxide" y ex="p. 11" /> for the assignment expression <$>{r`\exprplcasgn{\plc}{\expr}`}</$>:</p>

        <p>
          A valid assignment must be type-safe and ownership-safe. To be type-safe, the type of the expression <$>{r`\tys`}</$> must be a subtype of the place's type <$>{r`\stackenv_1(\plc)`}</$>. To be ownership-safe, the type must either be dead<Footnote>
            Oxide uses the metavariables <$>{r`\tyd`}</$> to mean "dead types" and <$>{r`\tysx`}</$> to mean "possibly dead types". A place becomes dead when it is moved, e.g. see <Smallcaps>T-Move</Smallcaps> in <Cite v="weiss2019oxide" y ex="p. 11" />. <Smallcaps>T-Assign</Smallcaps> allows a dead place to be revived. For instance, consider the program:

            <$$>{r`\exprlet{\vr}{\sty}{\text{\textquotedblleft}a"}{\exprseq{\msf{print}(\vr)}{\exprplcasgn{\vr}{\text{\textquotedblleft}b"}}}`}</$$>

            When <$>{r`\msf{print}(\vr)`}</$> moves <$>{r`\vr`}</$>, its type is updated to <$>{r`\tyds{\sty}`}</$> in <$>{r`\stackenv`}</$>. Then the <Smallcaps>T-Assign</Smallcaps> rule permits <$>{r`\vr`}</$> to be assigned again to "revive" that place, setting its type back to <$>{r`\sty`}</$>.
          </Footnote>, or <$>{r`\plc`}</$> must have unique ownership over itself, i.e. there should be no live references to <$>{r`\plc`}</$>. If so, then the type of <$>{r`\plc`}</$> is updated to <$>{r`\tys`}</$>.

        <p>Rather than referring to a lifetime directly, we instead use Oxide's ownership safety judgment described in <Ref name="sec:statsem" /> to get the corresponding loan set for a mutated place expression <$>{r`\pexp_\mut`}</$>.

        <p>A notable detail is that we do not compare the loan sets of <$>{r`\pexp_\mut`}</$> and <$>{r`\pexp_\any`}</$> to see if they contain conflicting places, but rather compare <$>{r`\pexp_\any`}</$> just against the loan set of <$>{r`\pexp_\mut`}</$>. This works because the loan set contains not just the set of places <$>{r`\plc`}</$> that <$>{r`\pexp_\mut`}</$> could point-to, but also the set of other references to the places <$>{r`\pexp_\mut`}</$> points-to (via reborrows).</p>

        <p>The idea behind <Ref name="thm:proc_eqarg" /> is that "influence" is translated into a form of noninterference: if the input to a function is the same under any two stacks <$>{r`\stack^1`}</$> and <$>{r`\stack^2`}</$>, then the mutations to that input must be the same. The rest of the stack is allowed to vary, but because the function <$>{r`\fname`}</$> cannot read it, that variation cannot influence the final value. </p>

        <p>To formalize "the input being the same", we introduce another auxiliary function for transitive equality. For instance, if we only required that <$>{r`\stack^1(\plc_\arrg) = \stack^2(\plc_\arrg)`}</$> where <$>{r`\plc_\arrg = \msf{ptr}~x`}</$>, then if <$>{r`\stack^1(x) \neq \stack^2(x)`}</$> the theorem would not be true. Hence, transitive equality is defined as equality including all pointed places. We define this concept through two pieces: a function for generating the set of places (denoted by <$>{r`P`}</$>), and a relation defining the equivalence of stacks for a set of places.</p>

        <$$>{r`
          \begin{align*}
            \cmddef{allplaces}{\allplaces{\pexp}{\tys}} &\eqdef \{\pexp\} \cup \refs{\shrd}{\pexp, \tys} \\
            \cmddef{stackeq}{\stackeq{\stack^1}{\stack^2}{P}} &\eqdef \forall \pexp \in P ~ . ~ \stack^1(\pexp) = \stack^2(\pexp)
          \end{align*}
        `}</$$>

        <Definition name="tex:allplaces" Tooltip={() => 
          <$>{r`\allplaces{\pexp}{\tys} \eqdef \{\pexp\} \cup \refs{\shrd}{\pexp, \tys}`}</$>} />
        <Definition name="tex:stackeq" Tooltip={() => 
          <$>{r`\stackeq{\stack^1}{\stack^2}{P} \eqdef \forall \pexp \in P ~ . ~ \stack^1(\pexp) = \stack^2(\pexp)`}</$>}/>

        <p>Therefore <Ref name="thm:proc_eqarg" /> states that if <$>{r`\plc_\arrg`}</$> is transitively equal under two otherwise arbitrary stacks, then <$>{r`\plc_\arrg`}</$> is still transitively equal after evaluating <$>{r`\fname(\plc_\arrg)`}</$> , and the output of <$>{r`\fname(\plc_\arrg)`}</$> is also equal.</p>
